<!-- 2. Purpose of Comments in HTML
Comments in HTML are used to leave notes or explanations within the code that are not displayed in the browser. They are useful for documenting the code, making it easier to understand and maintain. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use comments in an HTML document: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Comments in HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <!-- Comments are not displayed in the browser -->
</body>
</html>
